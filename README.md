# Generative models. AiMasters.

My homeworks for the Generative models course.

1. Autoregressive model on mnist.

2. VAE model on 2d data + on CIFAR-10.

3. Normalizing flow on two moons + MNIST

4. VAE with Autoregressive decoder on MNIST + VAE on flow-based prior on CIFAR-10

5. WGAN, WGAN + gp, SN-GAN (with spectral normalization)
